#+TITLE: Linear Algebra Part II

Requires: [[file:basic-linear-algebra.org][Linear Algebra Part I]]

We now move to the applications of linear algebra, studying properties of
matrices and vectors in finite-dimensional space.

* TODO Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

* TODO Diagonalisation

* TODO Jordan Canonical Form

* TODO Orthogonality
Does this really belong in this section?
