#+TITLE: Linear Algebra Part II

Requires: [[file:linear-algebra-1.org][Linear Algebra Part I]]

We now move to the applications of linear algebra, studying properties of
matrices and vectors in finite-dimensional space.

* TODO Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

* TODO Diagonalisation

* TODO Jordan Canonical Form

* TODO Orthogonality
Does this really belong in this section?

Orthogonality is an abstraction over the concept of 'perpendicular-ness'.

- The inner product of two vectors is defined as
  \[< \vec{v}, \vec{u} > = \sum_{j=1}^n u_j \overline{v}_j
  \]
- Two vectors are orthogonal if $< \vec{v}, \vec{u} > = 0$.
- A set of vectors is orthogonal if every vector in the set is orthogonal to
  every other vector (pairwise orthogonal).
